# C_Projects
This repository contains my C programming projects, including examples and practice exercises.

## Beginner

- **AREA CALCULATION:** Calculates the area of a triangle using base and height
- **PERIMETER CALCULATION:** Calculates the perimeter of a rectangle using two sides
- **CIRCLE AREA AND CIRCUMFERENCE:** Calculates the circumference and area of a circle
- **GREATEST NUMBER FINDER:** Finds the largest number among four user inputs
- **QUADRATIC EQUATION ROOTS:** Solves the quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0
- **SUM OF NUMBERS AND SQUARES:** Calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to a user-entered number & Calculates the sum of the squares of all integers from 1 to a user-entered number
- **AVERAGE OF NUMBERS: Calculates:** the average of user-entered numbers using a for loop
- **MULTIPLICATION USING ADDITION:** Multiplies two numbers by adding one number repeatedly instead of using the * operator.
- **MULTIPLICATION TABLE PLUS ONE:** Prints a 5x5 table where each cell is (row × column) + 1 using nested loops.
- **REVERSE NUMBER TRIANGLE:** Prints a triangle pattern where each row displays numbers in descending order starting from the row number  
- **PYRAMID STAR PATTERN:** Prints a centered pyramid made of stars (*) where each row adds two more stars than the previous one
- **DIGIT SUM AND REVERSE NUMBER:** Calculates the sum of digits of a user-entered number and also prints the number in reverse order.
- **ARRAY_OPERATIONS:** Basic array programs such as sum, min/max finder, averages, above-average count, closest value, and simple vector operations.
- **MATRIX_OPERATIONS:** Includes basic matrix programs such as finding the maximum value in a matrix, calculating the average of positive elements,  
  adding two matrices (A + B = C), and generating an identity matrix based on user-entered size.
